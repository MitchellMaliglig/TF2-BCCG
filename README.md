# Team Fortress 2 - Bot Console Command Generator (TF2-BCCG)

TF2-BCCG is an interactive web app desiged to aid TF2 players generate console commands that spawn in-game bots. Users can get started
by simply making an account. Once the user has an account, then they can visit the entries page and start creating some entries. Based on 
the input the user provides, a list of console commands will be generated, which can then be saved with an appropriate title and description.
After an entry has been saved, it will appear on the entries page alongside the other entries the user may have created. If the users wishes
to modify or delete an entry, they can click on the pencil icon for the given entry they wish to modify or delete, then proceed with said
action. Similarly, if the user wishes to use the console commands associated with an entry they created, then they can click on the paper icon
for the given entry, which will copy the appropriate commands onto the user's clipboard, after which they should visit the in-game console
and paste the commands and hit enter to spawn bots in-game as specified.
