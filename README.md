# TF2-BCCG

Team Fortress 2 - Bot Console Command Generator (TF2-BCCG) is an interactive web app designed to help TF2 players generate console commands for spawning in-game bots. Users can get started by creating an account. Once registered, they can visit the entries page to start creating entries. Based on the user input, a list of console commands is generated, which can be saved with an appropriate title and description. Saved entries will appear on the entries page alongside other user-created entries. To modify or delete an entry, users can click the pencil icon for the desired entry and proceed with their action. Similarly, to use the console commands associated with an entry, users can click the paper icon, which copies the commands to their clipboard. They can then paste the commands into the in-game console and hit enter to spawn the specified bots.
